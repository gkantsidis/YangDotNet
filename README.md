## Folder structure

This repo contains the following directories:

- `Models-External`: Contains repos to sources of YANG models. These are not linked
  as submodules, since some of them are quite big, and they are not always needed
  for development. To retrieve them run the `Download.ps1` PowerShell script from
  that directory.
